# PHPStormSourceTreeTest

1.  Team SensorSite Database Project Planning Requirements. 
The full plan for the project:  

  (a) We met with Mr. Franck Koestel, CEO of Sensor Products Inc., to review project parameters and client needs. We looked at the client’s various websites and determined that our project will focus on a particular website, sensorexpert.com.

  (b) We started reviewing and will soon select a mobile friendly web page template from WordPress.  Following selection, we will fully evaluate how this WordPress template works and compare it to the client’s current website.  (We are using WordPress as the company requests this approach.)

  (c) For the framework, we agreed with the client’s request that we use WordPress’custom themes and plugins, Angular 4, and Node.js.  

  (d) For an editor, we decided to start with Sublime Text, due to ease of Sublime’s set up and appearance.

  (e) We determined that less experienced team members will learn needed languages such as PHP, SQL, and JavaScript.

  (f) We decided that less experienced team members will begin work on the front-end of the website using the template as a reference.  Also, we decided that more experienced team members will initiate work on the necessary back-end data (using SQL and PHP).

  (g) Going forward, we agreed that when less experienced team members are sufficiently facile with SQL and/or PHP, they may assist in back-end work as well.

  (h) We will schedule future meetings with client, including various client staff members.

  (i) We determined that we will collect data from website users concerning the most interesting items on the website and will utilize this data to enhance our project.

  (j) When complete, we will submit iteration 1 and meet with the client to discuss the company’s suggestions for improving the project.




2. Our MVP:After meeting with Mr. Franck Koestel, CEO of Sensor Products, Inc., we determined that our minimum viable project (MVP) must include the following to meet the necessary requirements for the first iteration:

  (a) our website will be based on a template from the WordPress repository;

  (b) our website, while remaining user-friendly, must incorporate a contemporary look;

  (c) our version of the currently existing sensorexpert.com website will link to the client’s existing database of products, product information, and product pricing;

  (d) our website also will integrate the client’s existing shopping cart, using a WordPress plug-in;

  (e) our website will incorporate a design adaptable to the varying screens of Sensor Products’ customers.   



3. Development tools we plan to use to share code: We plan to use GitHub and SourceTree while working on our project.  Three team members already are familiar with GitHub and SourceTree, and it should be relatively easy for them to help the remaining group member to learn these tools.  The client will provide us with their private repository on its GitHub, which we will utilize.



4. Where we will host our application:
We will start out with hosting our application on the WordPress servers using the client's account. 



5. How we will coordinate team workload and communication:
For coordinating communications, we plan on using GroupMe.  GroupMe is easy to use, already used for classes, and is quicker than using emails.  We previously installed GroupMe because it was utilized in prior CSCI classes.For coordinating team workload, we will divide tasks based on experience level with languages and the difficulty of specific tasks.  Our more experienced team members will work on more advanced languages such as PHP and SQL, while less experienced team members will work on HTML/CSS/JavaScript (while learning PHP and SQL).  To help balance team members’ workload (so that each member is contributing a similar amount of time and effort), members using easier languages will undertake more tasks as compared to the members implementing more difficult languages.
