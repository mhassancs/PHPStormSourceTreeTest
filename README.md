Team SensorSite Database Project Planning Requirements:
  (a) We met with Mr. Franck Koestel, CEO of Sensor Products Inc., to review project parameters and client needs. We looked at the client’s various websites and determined that our project will focus on a particular website, sensorexpert.com.
  (b) We started reviewing and will soon select a mobile friendly web page template from WordPress.  Following selection, we will fully evaluate how this WordPress template works and compare it to the client’s current website.  (We are using WordPress as the company requests this approach.)
  (c) For the framework, we agreed with the client’s request that we use WordPress’custom themes and plugins, Angular 4, and Node.js.  
  (d) For an editor, we decided to start with Sublime Text, due to ease of Sublime’s set up and appearance.
  (e) We determined that less experienced team members will learn needed languages such as PHP, SQL, and JavaScript.
  (f) We decided that less experienced team members will begin work on the front-end of the website using the template as a reference.  Also, we decided that more experienced team members will initiate work on the necessary back-end data (using SQL and PHP).
  (g) Going forward, we agreed that when less experienced team members are sufficiently facile with SQL and/or PHP, they may assist in back-end work as well.
  (h) We will schedule future meetings with client, including various client staff members.
  (i) We determined that we will collect data from website users concerning the most interesting items on the website and will utilize this data to enhance our project.
  (j) When complete, we will submit iteration 1 and meet with the client to discuss the company’s suggestions for improving the project.



After meeting with Mr. Franck Koestel, CEO of Sensor Products, Inc., we determined that our minimum viable project (MVP) must include the following to meet the necessary requirements for the first iteration:

  (a) our website will be based on a template from the WordPress repository;
  (b) our website, while remaining user-friendly, must incorporate a contemporary look;
  (c) our version of the currently existing sensorexpert.com website will link to the client’s existing database of products, product information, and product pricing;
  (d) our website also will integrate the client’s existing shopping cart, using a WordPress plug-in;
  (e) our website will incorporate a design adaptable to the varying screens of Sensor Products’ customers.  
	(f) our website will allow users to hover over menu bar in order to find product options quickly 
	(g) our website will allow administrators to access list of people who filled in the contact us form
	(h) our website will have distinct sections in menu for both types of products sold
	(i) our website will custom products need a request a demo button that leads to contact us page
	(j) our website will custom products should NOT be able to go in shopping cart
	(k) our website will off-the-shelf products should be able to go in shopping cart

	

We plan to use GitHub and PHPStorm while working on our project. This allows us to directly commit to github. Oir site will be hosted on the WordPress servers using the client's account. For coordinating communications, our team used GroupMe.  GroupMe is easy to use, already used for classes, and is quicker than using emails.  We divided tasks based on experience level with languages and the difficulty of specific tasks.  Our more experienced team members worked on more advanced languages while less experienced team members worked with more front end and plug-in (while learning PHP and SQL).
